Hi! I'm a software engineer currently working at SoundHound AI. I recently graduated from Stanford University with my Bachelor's and Master's in computer science, where I specialized in artificial intelligence. During my time at school, I developed a love for all things language and I'm particularly interested in how technology can help us better understand the role and usage of language, whether through a linguistic or sociological lens. 

This website is still in progress, but hopefully at some point it includes some cool projects and blog posts as I keep learning :)
